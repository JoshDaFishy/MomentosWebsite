    <h1>The Book of Momentos</h1>
    <p>This book details and dictates all the noteworthy events on the server, and is the most important. It is mostly written by AKG and Co-edited by
    Conqu3red. All lore in this book passes though the current server owner (JoshDaFishy) before being agreed upon. This version has been proof read and tweaked by Alfie (Ghostblockster) </p>
    <h2>Prolouge (Days 0-4999)</h2>
    <p>At first, the outlanders descended unto the land, known to them as Momentos. A thriving and diverse land, though a land that no doubt should have been left undisturbed. Yet, of course, they did anyway, for their own sake. For the sake of survival. </p>

    <p>Villages were raided and their inhabitants senselessly slaughtered by the first two to descend upon the world. Many previously peaceful animals met their end by the cold edge of an axe.</p>

    <p>Yet they continued, for the first handful of days and nights.</p>

    <p>Finally, they ended this rampage, and across the ocean from The Spawn - the place in which all outlanders first descend into this world - they came across "The Hill", though in their elder speech it gained the name “A’Bheinn.” The “Bheinn Alliance” eventually became the Beinn, the folk government that had authority over the capitol of Momentos.</p>

    <p>In the time that followed, several more outlanders came to the world and settled in a community at Beinn. This was all until one of the founders of this land - one particularly mean-spirited individual - was struck from the world, disappearing with nothing but a trace to remain. Could it have just been the karma that made him, specifically, disappear? Could it have been the work of the Gods, overseeing all actions of the world?</p>

    <p>It was a while after this, a time for progress of Beinn, a golden age of trade, peace, and unity for the community that resided on this hill, that a new movement of revolutionary thinkers gathered in the depths of A’Bheinn’s mines and quiet corners. They proposed a world where control was not central and where clashes and competition would drive a cleaner and more efficient society. They met and discussed their plans in secret against the laws of Beinn and chose Gengolor as their leader to head their new group – Thetonia. They were still but a small collection of people, but they were to one day become a great empire and lead into a new era of Factionism.</p>

    <p>The foundations of Beinn and Thetonia aside, A great upheaval came in the early days of Momentos, one that would change the destiny of everything... Upon the discovery and activation of the unusual portals in the strongholds, the inhabitants of early Beinn found a dark and cold place protected by a fierce and fiery dragon. They called it the End. Of course, they took it upon themselves to rid The End of its murderous ruler. While, despite having many people, this was no easy feat, the Dragon was defeated after some time. And, as is fated in all worlds, its egg was awarded as a prize to those who dare confront it and stay standing. The first Egg was displayed upon a shrine in the centre of Beinn.</p>

    <p>Yet the pioneers of the End were quick to begin scouring the now tamed dimension for the legendary wings that were once spoken in ancient and now nearly lost lore that would grant their user the power of flight. It was said by some that the Second was found in an ancient shrine to a mysterious second dragon, though others claimed that it was a product of the still only partially tamed dimensions. All considered it a miracle allowed by only divine intervention. It was placed on a solid quartz pedestal besides its sister and admired by all who gazed upon them. This pedestal was to be the scene of an act whose magnitude would be so great that it would permanently change the direction of Momentos. The laws and culture would be violated for the first time.</p>

    <p>The eggs were found empty from their pedestals, with not a trace of evidence as who carried out this deplorable heist.</p>

    <p>By the end, as the 5000-Day-Ceremony drew closer, all were at unease. The long-kept peace and sense of unity that had been once enjoyed by the residents of the Beinn was beginning to stretch, and it soon became apparent that the ways of the early days were at their end.</p>
