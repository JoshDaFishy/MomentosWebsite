    <h1>Welcome to MomentosDe!</h1>
    <p>MomentosDe is a small survival multiplayer server that currently consists of thirteen people. It has been online for about 5 months and we are in the late game.
    We have a large interconnected nether tunnel system, full automation on most resources, and though a fluke in game mechanics, two dragon eggs. Though we are not
    solely role-play focussed, there is an active lore and faction system that is unique to the server. Currently there are no openings for new players.</p>
    <h1>Our Factions:</h1>
    <h2>The Beinn Empire</h2>
    <div class="sidebyside">
      <img src="img/beinn.png" alt="Beinn flag">
      <p>The Beinn empire is currently the only entity on the server to not identify itself as a faction. It has control over multiple territories, including
        two special status regions, those being the server capital, The Hill Republic, and The Autonomous Tree Nation, which has voting rights in our council as part of an agreement.
        Beinn organises and records the council meetings, factions wars and acts as an a general enforcer of fair play and law. We currently have three members, making us the joint largest
        group, alongside Thetonia.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Thetonia</h2>
    <div class="sidebyside">
      <img src="img/theta.png" alt="Thetonia flag" width="40%">
      <p>Thetonia is the oldest true faction in the server, being that we originally didn't allow people to make factions, though these guys made a secret one anyway. They pioneered the faction system and
      are a major power on the server. They have a long and interesting story, and many outposts and buildings. Currently one of the owners of our two dragon eggs, and are the wealthiest
      faction on the server by raw volume of valuable material. They have three members, and are genuinely a force to be reckoned with if you ever have the bad luck of warring
      against them.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>The Wall</h2>
    <div class="sidebyside">
      <img src="img/thewall.png" alt="The flag of the Wall" width="40%">
      <p>A new faction that has only been recognised recently, but they are growing quickly, having two members and the title of second largest faction on server. The have an unusual walled capital
      whom they derive their name from, and they are mostly traders of materials like chicken and other low-tier items. </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Sacren</h2>
    <div class="sidebyside">
      <img src="img/sacren.png" alt="Flag of Sacren" width="40%">
      <p>Though Sacren is one of the smallest factions on the server by player count, their ambition, aggressive foreign policy and material wealth has mad them on of the server's main powers.
      They have rule over Inlex, a city larger than the hill, and are avid builders of infrastructure who drive a hard bargain. They are currently the owners of the second dragon egg, and
      they have a massive castle to prove it too. They write and record much of the greater lore of the server.</p>
    </div>
        <h2>The Autonomous Tree Nation</h2>
    <div class="sidebyside">
      <img src="img/treenation.png" alt="Tree Nation Flag" width="40%">
      <p>Though they are technically part of the Beinn Empire, they still deserve a place here due to their seat on the council and their large degree of autonomy, the tree nation is dedicated
      to the preservation of nature across Momentos, and as so they have jurastiction over how people farm forests and such. They used to be based near the Industrial District, acting as protectors
      for the local wildlife, though they have had to leave in recent times due to a series of unfortunate events.</p>
